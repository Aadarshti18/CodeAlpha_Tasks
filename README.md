## Task 1: Basic Network Sniffer Using Python

### Description
This task involves developing a basic network sniffer using Python to capture and analyze network packets.  
The objective is to understand how data is transmitted across a network and how packet-level inspection works.

### Tools and Technologies
- Python  
- Scapy Library  

### Files Included
- Network_Sniffer.py – Python script for capturing and analyzing packets  
- Report.md – Detailed explanation of the implementation and observations  

### Key Concepts
- Packet capturing  
- Source and destination IP analysis  
- Protocol identification  
- Network traffic monitoring

## Task 3: Source Code Review (Secure vs Vulnerable Code)

### Description
This task demonstrates how insecure code can introduce security vulnerabilities and how the same code can be improved using secure coding practices.

### Technologies Used
- Python  

### Files Included
- vulnerable_code/insecure_login.py – Example of insecure implementation  
- secure_code/secure_login.py – Secure version of the same functionality  
- Report/Report.md – Explanation of vulnerabilities and corresponding fixes  

### Key Concepts
- Secure authentication practices  
- Input validation  
- Secure handling of user credentials  
- Identification and mitigation of common security flaws
